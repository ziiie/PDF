<P class="p0 ft3">ABOUT THE AUTHOR</P>
<P class="p3 ft4">Genevieve Behrend was the only personal student of Thomas Troward the master of "Mental Science."</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">"Your Invisible Power" is a powerful, yet simple and easy guide.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">This book can teach you how to use the power of visualization and other processes taught by Thomas Troward to transform your life.</P>
<P class="p6 ft5">Behrend says, "We all possess more power and greater possibilities than we realize, and visualizing is one of the greatest of these powers. It brings other possibilities to our observation. When we pause to think for a moment, we realize that for a cosmos to exist at all, it must be the outcome of a cosmic mind."</P>
<P class="p7 ft5">From 1912 to 1914, Genevieve Behrend’s life focused solely on the wisdom and philosophy of Thomas Troward (1847- 1916) who’s influential and compelling ideas provided much of the groundwork to the spiritual philosophy known today as New Thought.</P>
<P class="p8 ft5">As the awareness of “mental science” was taking shape, Troward imparted his personal insight to only one pupil who could perpetuate this knowledge and share it with the world.</P>
<P class="p9 ft4">YOUR INVISIBLE POWER remains Behrend's most powerful and popular work.</P>
<P class="p10 ft5">After her studies with Troward, Behrend began her mission in New York City where she established and ran The School of the Builders until 1925. She then established another school in Los Angeles before touring other major cities throughout North America for the next 35 years as a celebrated lecturer, teacher, and practitioner of "Mental Science".</P>

<P class="p0 ft7">Forward</P>
<P class="p24 ft5">THESE pages have been written for the purpose of furnishing you a key to the attainment of your desires, and to explain that Fear should be entirely banished from your consciousness in order for you to obtain possession of the things you want.</P>
<P class="p25 ft5">This presupposes, of course, that your desire for possession is based upon your aspiration for greater happiness. For example, you feel that the possession of more money, lands, or friends will make you happier, and your desire for possession of these things arises from a conviction that their possession will bring you freedom and contentment.</P>
<P class="p26 ft4">In your effort to possess, you will discover that the thing you most need is to consistently “Be” your best self.</P>
<P class="p27 ft5">One morning after class a man came to me and asked if I would speak the word of supply for him, as he was sadly in the need of money. He offered me a $5 bill with the remark: “Dear Madam, that is half of every dollar I have in the world. I am in debt; my wife and child have not the proper clothing; in fact, I must have money.” I explained to him that money was the symbol of differentiated substance, that this substance filled all space, that it was present for him at that very moment, and would manifest to him as the money he required. “But,” he questioned, “it may come too late.” I told him it could not come too late, as it was eternally present. He understood and got the uplift of my spoken word.</P>
<P class="p28 ft5">I did not see the man again, but six months later I had a letter from him stating he was in New Orleans. He said, “I am well established here in my regular profession of photography; I own my own home, have an automobile of my own, and am generally prospering. And dear Mrs. Behrend, I want to thank you for lifting me out of the depths that day in New York.</P>
<P class="p29 ft5">Three days after I talked to you, a man whom I have not seen for years met me on the street. When I explained my situation to him, he loaned me the money to pay my bills and come down</P>

<P class="p30 ft5">here. The enclosed check is to help you continue your wonderful work of teaching people how to mentally reach out and receive their <NOBR>never-failing</NOBR> supply. I would not take anything for my understanding as you have given it to me. God bless you.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft5">A feeling that greater possessions, no matter of what kind they may be, will of themselves bring contentment or happiness, is a misunderstanding. No person, place, or thing can give you happiness. They may give you cause for happiness and a feeling of contentment, but the Joy of Living comes from within.</P>
<P class="p32 ft5">Therefore, it is here recommended that you should make the effort to obtain the things which you feel will bring you joy, provided that your desires are in accord with the Joy of Living.</P>
<P class="p21 ft5">It is also desired, in this volume, to suggest the possibilities in store for all who make persistent effort to understand the Law of Visualization, and who make practical application of this knowledge on whatever plane they may be. The word “effort,” as here employed, is not intended to convey the idea of strain. All study and meditation should be without strain or tension.</P>
<P class="p21 ft5">It has been my endeavor to show that by starting at the beginning of the creative action, or mental picture, certain corresponding results are sure to follow. “While the laws of the Universe cannot be altered, they can be made to work under specific conditions, thereby producing results for individual advancement which cannot be obtained under the spontaneous workings of the law provided by Nature.” However far these suggestions I have given <NOBR>—of</NOBR> the possibilities in store for you, through visualizing, may carry you beyond your past experience, they nowhere break the continuity of the law of cause and effect.</P>
<P class="p33 ft5">If through the suggestions here given, any one is brought to realize that his mind is a center through and in which “all power there is” is in operation, simply waiting to be given direction in the one and only way through which it can take specific action— and this means reaction in concrete or physical <NOBR>form—then</NOBR> the mission to which this book is dedicated has been fulfilled.</P>

<DIV id="page_8">


<DIV id="id8_1">
<P class="p34 ft5">Try to remember that the picture you think, feel, and see is reflected into the Universal Mind, and by the natural law of reciprocal action must return to you in either spiritual or physical form. Knowledge of this law of reciprocal action between the individual and the Universal Mind opens to you free access to all you may wish to possess or to be.</P>
<P class="p35 ft5">It must be steadfastly borne in mind that all this can be true only for the individual who recognizes that he derives his power to make an abiding mental picture from the <NOBR>All-Originating</NOBR> Universal Spirit of Life, and can be used constructively only so long as it is employed and retained in harmony with the nature of the Spirit which originated it.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">To insure this, there must be no inversion of the thought of the individual regarding his relationship to this Universal Originating Spirit, which is that of a son, through which the parent mind acts and reacts. Thus conditioned, whatever you think and feel yourself to be, the Creative Spirit of Life is bound to faithfully reproduce in a corresponding reaction.</P>
<P class="p36 ft5">This is the great reason for picturing yourself and your affairs the way you wish them to be as existing facts— though invisible to the physical <NOBR>eye—and</NOBR> living in your picture. An honest endeavor to do this, always recognizing that your own mind is a projection of the Originating Spirit, will prove to you that the best there is, is yours in all your ways.</P>

<P class="p38 ft3">CHAPTER I</P>
<P class="p39 ft3">Order of Visualization</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">THE exercise of the visualizing faculty keeps your mind in order, and attracts to you the things you need to make life more enjoyable in an orderly way.</P>
<P class="p40 ft5">If you train yourself in the practice of deliberately picturing your desire and carefully examining your picture, you will soon find that your thoughts and desires proceed in a more orderly procession than ever before.</P>
<P class="p41 ft5">Having reached a state of ordered mentality, you are no longer in a constant state of mental hurry. Hurry is Fear, and consequently destructive. In other words, when your understanding grasps the power to visualize your heart’s desire and hold it with your will, it attracts to you all things requisite to the fulfillment of that picture by the harmonious vibrations of the law of attraction.</P>
<P class="p36 ft5">You realize that since Order is Heaven’s first law, and visualization places things in their natural order, then it must be a heavenly thing to visualize. Everyone visualizes, whether he knows it or not. Visualizing is the great secret of success.</P>
<P class="p42 ft5">The conscious use of this great power attracts to you multiplied resources, intensifies your wisdom, and enables you to make use of advantages which you formerly failed to recognize.</P>
<P class="p43 ft5">A lady once came to me for help in selling a piece of property. After I explained to her just how to make a mental picture of the sale, going through the details mentally, exactly as she would do if the property were sold, she came a week later and told me how one day she was walking along the street, when the thought suddenly occurred to her to go and see a certain real estate dealer, to whom she had not yet been.</P>
<P class="p44 ft5">She hesitated for a moment when she first got the idea, as it seemed to her that that man could not sell her property. However, upon the strength of what I had told her, she followed the lead</P>

<DIV id="id10_1">
<P class="p45 ft5">and went to the real estate man, who sold the property for her in just three days after she had first approached him. This was simply following along with the natural law of demand and supply.</P>
<P class="p21 ft5">We now fly through the air, not because anyone has been able to change the laws of Nature, but because the inventor of the flying machine learned how to apply Nature’s laws and, by making orderly use of them, produced the desired result. So far as the natural forces are concerned, nothing has changed since the beginning. There were no airplanes in “the Year One,” because those of that generation could not conceive the idea as a practical, working possibility. “It has not yet been done,” was the argument, “and it cannot be done.” Yet the laws and materials for practical flying machines existed then as now.</P>
<P class="p46 ft5">Troward tells us that the great lesson he learned from the airplane and wireless telegraphy is the triumph of principle over precedent, the working out of an idea to its logical conclusion in spite of accumulated contrary testimony of all past experience.</P>
<P class="p47 ft5">With such an example before you, you must realize that there are still greater secrets to be disclosed. Also, that you hold the key within yourself, with which to unlock the secret chamber that contains your heart’s desire.</P>
<P class="p47 ft5">All that is necessary in order that you may use this key and make your life exactly what you wish it to be, is a careful inquiry into the unseen causes which stand back of every external and visible condition. Then bring these unseen causes into harmony with your conception, and you will find that you can make practical working realities of possibilities which at present seem but fantastic dreams.”</P>
<P class="p48 ft5">A woman came to me in New York City, asking for help, as she was out of work. I spoke the word of <NOBR>ever-present</NOBR> supply for her and intensified it by mentally seeing the woman in the position she dreamed of, but which she had been unable to make a practical reality.</P>

<P class="p49 ft5">That same afternoon she telephoned and said she could hardly believe her senses, as she had just taken exactly the kind of a position she wanted. The employer told her she had been wanting a woman like her for months.</P>
<P class="p50 ft5">We all knew that the balloon was the forefather of the airplane. In 1766 Henry Cavendish, an English nobleman, proved that hydrogen gas was seven times lighter than air. From that discovery the balloon came into existence, and from the ordinary balloon the dirigible, a <NOBR>cigar-shaped</NOBR> airship, was evolved.</P>
<P class="p51 ft5">Study of aeronautics and laws of the aerial locomotion of birds and projectiles led to the belief that mechanism could be evolved by which <NOBR>heavier-than-air</NOBR> machines could be made to travel from place to place and remain in the air by the maintenance of great speed, which would overcome by propulsive force the ordinary law of gravitation. Professor Langley of Washington, who developed much of the theory which others afterward improved upon, was subjected to much derision when he sent a model airplane up, only to have it bury its nose in the muddy waters of the Potomac.</P>
<P class="p52 ft5">But the Wright Brothers, who experimented later, realized the possibility of traveling through the air in a machine that had no gas bag. They saw themselves enjoying this mode of transportation with great facility. It is said that one of the brothers would tell the other, when their varied experiences did not turn out as they expected: “It’s all right, Brother, I can see myself riding in that machine, and it travels easily and steadily.”</P>
<P class="p7 ft5">Those Wright Brothers knew what they wanted and kept their pictures constantly before them. Now transportation through the air is developing rapidly and we all feel sure it will in the near future become as ordinary a method of travel as the automobile.</P>
<P class="p53 ft5">In visualizing, or making a mental picture, you are not endeavoring to change the laws of Nature. You are fulfilling them.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">Your object in visualizing is to bring things into regular order,</P>

<P class="p54 ft5">both mentally and physically. When you realize that this method of employing the Creative Power brings your desires, one after another, into practical, material accomplishment, your confidence in the mysterious but unfailing law of attraction, which has its central power station in the very heart of your <NOBR>word-picture,</NOBR> becomes supreme. Nothing can shake it. You never feel that it is necessary to take anything from anybody else. You have learned that asking and seeking have, as their correlatives, receiving and finding. You know that all you have to do is to start the plastic substance of the Universe flowing into the <NOBR>thought-moulds</NOBR> your <NOBR>picture-desire</NOBR> provides.</P>
<P class="p55 ft3">CHAPTER II</P>
<P class="p56 ft3">How to Attract To Yourself</P>
<P class="p57 ft3">The Things You Desire</P>
<P class="p58 ft5">THE power within you which enables you to form a thought- picture is the starting point of all there is. In its original state it is the undifferentiated formless substance of life. Your thought- picture makes the model, so to say, into which this formless substance takes shape.</P>
<P class="p59 ft5">Visualizing, or mentally seeing things and conditions as you wish them to be, is the condensing, the specializing power in you which might be illustrated by comparison with the lens of a magic lantern, which is one of the best symbols of the imaging faculty.</P>
<P class="p60 ft5">It illustrates the idea of the working of the Creative Spirit on the plane of initiative and <NOBR>selection—or</NOBR> in its concentrated, specializing form <NOBR>—in</NOBR> a remarkably clear manner. The picture slide illustrates your own mental <NOBR>picture—invisible</NOBR> in the lantern of your mind until you turn on the light of your will.</P>
<P class="p61 ft5">That is to say, you light up your desire with absolute faith that the Creative Spirit of Life, in you, is doing the work. By the steady flow of the light of the Will on the Spirit, your desired picture is projected upon the screen of the physical <NOBR>world—an</NOBR> exact reproduction of the pictured slide in your mind.</P>

<DIV id="id13_1">
<P class="p62 ft5">A woman came to me for help to cause her husband to return to her. She said she was very unhappy and lonely without him and longed to be reunited. I told her she could not lose love and protection, because both belonged to her. She asked what she should do to get her husband back again. I told her to follow the great power of intuition and think of her husband as perfectly free, and the embodiment of all that a husband should be.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">She went away quite happy, but returned in a few days to tell me that her husband desired a divorce in order to marry again. She was quite agitated and had evidently relaxed her will in following the instructions given at the former interview. Again I told her to hold constantly in her mind that the loving protection of the Spirit of Life would guide her in perfect happiness.</P>
<P class="p63 ft5">A month later she came again and said that her husband had married the other woman. This time she had completely lost her mental grip. I repeated the words for her as before, and she regained her poise. Two months later she came back to me, full of joy. Her husband had come to her, begging her forgiveness, and telling her what a terrible mistake he had made, as he could not be happy without her. They are now living happily together and she, at least, learned the necessity of holding her pictured desire steadily in place by the use of her will.</P>
<P class="p64 ft5">Visualizing without a will sufficiently steady to inhibit every thought and feeling contrary to your pictured thought would be as useless as a magic lantern without the light.</P>
<P class="p65 ft5">On the other hand, if your will is sufficiently developed to bold your picture in thought and feeling, without any “ifs”; simply realizing that your thought is the great attracting power, then your mental picture is as certain to be projected upon your physical world as a picture slide put into a magic lantern shows on the screen. Try projecting the picture in a magic lantern with a light that is constantly shifting from one side to the other, and you will produce the effect of an uncertain will. It is as necessary that you should always have back of your picture a strong, steady will, as it is to have a strong steady light back of a picture slide.</P>

<P class="p66 ft5">The joyous assurance with which you make your picture is the very powerful magnet of Faith, and nothing can obliterate it. You are happier than you ever were, because you have learned to know where your source of supply is, and you rely upon its never- failing response to the direction you give it.</P>
<P class="p67 ft5">All said and done, happiness is the one thing which every human being wants, and the study of visualization enables you to get more out of life than you ever enjoyed before. Increasing possibilities keep opening out, more and more, before you.</P>
<P class="p68 ft5">A business man once told me that since practicing visualization, and forming the habit of devoting a few minutes each day to thinking about his work as he desired it to be, in a large, broad way, his orders had more than doubled in six months.</P>
<P class="p69 ft5">His method was to go into a room every morning before breakfast and take a mental inventory of his business as he had left it the evening before, and then enlarge upon it. He said he expanded and expanded in this way, until his affairs were in a remarkably successful condition. He would see himself in his office doing everything he wanted done. His occupation required him to meet many strangers every day.</P>
<P class="p70 ft5">In his mental picture he saw himself meeting these people, understanding their needs, and supplying them in just the way they wished. This habit, he said, had strengthened and steadied his will in an almost inconceivable manner.</P>
<P class="p59 ft5">Furthermore, by thus mentally seeing things as he wished them to be, he had acquired the confident feeling that a certain Creative Power was exercising itself, for him and through him, for the purpose of improving his little world.</P>
<P class="p71 ft5">When you first begin to visualize seriously, you may feel, as many others do, that someone else may be forming the same picture you are, and that, naturally, would not suit your purpose. Do not give yourself any concern about this.</P>

<P class="p72 ft5">the Universal Creative Power specifically applied. Then you may be sure that no one can work in opposition to you. The universal law of harmony prevents that.</P>
<P class="p73 ft5">Endeavor to bear in mind that your mental picture is Universal Mind specifically exercising its inherent powers of initiative and selection. God, or Universal Mind, made man for the special purpose of differentiating Himself through him. Everything there is, came into existence in this same way, by this <NOBR>self-same</NOBR> law of <NOBR>self-differentiation,</NOBR> and for the same purpose. First came the idea, the mental picture, or the prototype of the thing, which is the thing itself in its incipiency. The Great Architect of the Universe contemplated Himself as manifesting through his polar <NOBR>opposite—matter—and</NOBR> the idea expanded and projected itself until we have not only a world, but many worlds.</P>
<P class="p74 ft5">Many people ask, “But why should we have a physical world at all?” The answer is: “Because it is the nature of Originating Substance to solidify, under directivity rather than activity, just as it is the nature of wax to harden when it becomes cold, or plaster of paris to become firm and solid when exposed to the air.</P>
<P class="p75 ft5">Your picture is this same Divine Substance in its original state, taking form through the individualized center of Divine operation, in your mind; and there is no power to prevent this combination of Spiritual Substance from becoming physical form. It is the nature of Spirit to complete its work, and an idea is not complete until it has made for itself a vehicle.</P>
<P class="p76 ft4">Nothing can prevent your picture from coming into concrete form except the same power which gave it <NOBR>birth—yourself.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p77 ft5">Suppose you wish to have a more orderly room. You look about your room, and the idea of order suggests boxes, closets, shelves, hooks, and so forth. The box, the closet and the hooks, are all concrete ideas of order, because they are the vehicles through which order and harmony suggest themselves.</P>

<P class="p78 ft3">CHAPTER III</P>
<P class="p79 ft3">Relation between Mental and Physical Form</P>
<P class="p80 ft5">SOME persons feel that it is not quite proper to visualize for things. “It’s too material,” they say. Why, material form is necessary for the <NOBR>self-recognition</NOBR> of Spirit from the individual standpoint, and this is the means through which the Creative Process is carried forward.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">Therefore, far from matter being an illusion and something which ought not to be, matter is the necessary channel for the self- differentiation of Spirit.</P>
<P class="p81 ft5">However, it is not my desire to lead you into lengthy and tiresome scientific reasoning, in order to remove the mystery from visualization and to put it upon a logical foundation.</P>
<P class="p40 ft5">Naturally, each individual will do this in his own way. My only wish is to point out to you the easiest way I know, which is the road on which Troward guides me. I feel sure you will conclude, as I have, that the only mystery in connection with visualizing is the mystery of life taking form, governed by unchangeable and easily understood laws.</P>
<P class="p82 ft5">We all possess more power and greater possibilities than we realize, and visualizing is one of the greatest of these powers, it brings other Possibilities to our observation. When we pause to think for a moment, we realize that for a cosmos to exist at all, it must be the outcome of a Cosmic Mind, which binds “all individual minds to a certain generic unity of action, thereby producing all things as realities and nothing as illusions.”</P>
<P class="p83 ft5">If you will take this thought of Troward’s and meditate upon it without prejudice, you will surely realize that concrete material form is an absolute necessity of the Creative Process; also “that matter is not an illusion but a necessary channel thru which life differentiates itself.” If you consider matter in its right order, as the polar opposite to Spirit, you will not find any antagonism between them. On the contrary, together they constitute one harmonious whole. And when you realize this, you feel, in your</P>

</DIV>
<DIV id="page_17">


<DIV id="id17_1">
<P class="p84 ft4">practice of visualizing, that you are working from cause to effect, from beginning to end.</P>
<P class="p85 ft5">In reality your mental picture is the specialized outworking of the Originating Spirit. One could talk for hours on purely scientific lines, showing, as Troward says, “that raw material for the formation of the solar systems is universally distributed throughout all space. Yet investigation shows that while the Heavens are studded with millions of suns, there are spaces which show no signs of cosmic activity. This being true, there must be something which started cosmic activity in certain places, while passing over others in which the raw material was equally available. At first thought, one might attribute development of cosmic energy to the etheric particles themselves. Upon investigation however, we find that this is mathematically impossible in a medium which is equally distributed throughout space, for all its particles are in equilibrium; therefore, no one particle possesses in itself a greater power of originating motion than the other. Thus we find that the initial movement, though working in and through the particles of primary substance, is not the particles themselves. It is this something we mean when we speak of Spirit.”</P>
<P class="p86 ft5">This same power that brought universal substance into existence will bring your individual thought or mental picture into physical form. There is no difference in the power. The only difference is a difference of degree. The power and the substance themselves are the same. Only in working out your mental picture, it has transferred its creative energy from the Universal to the particular, and is working in the same unfailing manner from its specific center, your mind.</P>
<P class="p87 ft3">CHAPTER IV</P>
<P class="p88 ft3">Operation of Your Mental Picture</P>
<P class="p40 ft5">THE operation of a large telephone system may be used as a simile. The main, or head central subdivides itself into many branch centrals, every branch being in direct connection with the main central, and each individual branch recognizing the source</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id17_2">
<P class="p0 ft2">This HTML is created from PDF at <NOBR><A href="https://www.pdfonline.com/convert-pdf-to-html/">https://www.pdfonline.com/convert-pdf-to-html/</A></NOBR></P>

<DIV id="id18_1">
<P class="p89 ft5">of its existence, reports all things to its central head. Therefore, when assistance of any nature is required: new supplies, difficult repairs to be done, or what not, the branch in need goes at once to its central head. It would not think of referring its difficulties (or its successes) to the main central of a telegraph system, though they might belong to the same organization. These different branch centrals know that the only remedy for any difficulty must come from the central out of which they were projected and to which they are always attached.</P>
<P class="p90 ft5">If we, as individual branches of the Universal Mind, would refer our difficulties in the same confident manner to the source from which we were projected, and use the remedies which it has provided, we would realize what Jesus meant when he said, “Ask and ye shall receive.” Our every requirement would be met. Surely the Father must supply the child. The trunk of the tree cannot fail to provide for its branches.</P>
<P class="p91 ft5">A man came to me in great distress, saying he was about to lose his home in the South. In his own words, it was mortgaged to the hilt, and his creditors were going to foreclose. It was the house in which he had been born and had grown to young manhood, and the thought of losing it filled his heart and mind with sorrow, not only from a money standpoint, but from the standpoint of sentimental association.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">I explained to him that the Power that brought him into existence did so for the purpose of expressing its limitless supply through him; that there was no power on earth which could cut him off from his source except his own consciousness, and that in reality he would not be cut off then. I explained to him that he had it, but was unable to recognize that it was there, and said to him, “Infinite substance is manifesting in you right now.”</P>
<P class="p92 ft5">The next week, on Sunday, just before leaving my dressing room in the Selwyn Theatre to give my afternoon message, I received the following note:</P>
<P class="p93 ft4">“Dear Mrs. Behrend: I want you to know that I am the happiest man in the whole city of New York. My home in the South is</P>

<DIV id="id19_1">
<P class="p62 ft5">saved. The money came in the most miraculous way, and I have telegraphed enough to pay off the mortgage. Please tell the people this afternoon about this wonderful Power.”</P>
<P class="p94 ft5">You may be sure I did, explaining to them that everything animate or inanimate is called into existence or outstandingness by a Power which itself does not stand out. The Power which creates the mental <NOBR>picture—the</NOBR> Originating Spirit Substance of your pictured <NOBR>desire—does</NOBR> not stand out. It projects the substance of itself, which is a solidified counterpart of itself, while <NOBR>it—the</NOBR> <NOBR>Power—remains</NOBR> invisible to the physical eye. Those will appreciate the value of visualizing who are able to realize Paul’s meaning when he said, “The worlds were formed by the word of God. Things which are seen are not made of things which do appear.”</P>
<P class="p74 ft5">There is nothing unusual or mysterious in the idea of your pictured desire coming into material evidence. It is the working of a universal, natural Law. The world was projected by the self- contemplation of the Universal Mind, and this same action is taking place in its individualized branch which is the Mind of Man. Everything in the whole world, from the hat on your head to the boots on your feet, has its beginning in mind and comes into existence in exactly the same manner. All are projected thoughts, solidified. Your personal advance in evolution depends on your right use of the power of visualizing, and your use of it depends on whether you recognize that you, yourself, are a particular center through and in which the Originating Spirit is finding ever new expression for potentialities already existing within Itself. This is evolution.</P>
<P class="p95 ft5">Your mental picture is the force of attraction which evolves and combines the Originating Substance into specific shape. Your picture is the combining and evolving power house, in a generative sense, so to say, through which the Originating Creative Spirit expresses itself. Its creative action is limitless, without beginning and without end, and always progressive and orderly. “It proceeds stage by stage, each stage being a necessary preparation for the one to follow.”</P>

<DIV id="page_20">


<DIV id="id20_1">
<P class="p96 ft4">Now let us see if we can get an idea of the different stages by which the things in the world have come to be.</P>
<P class="p92 ft5">Troward says, “If we can get at the working principle which is producing these results, we can very quickly and easily give it personal application. First, we find that the thought of Originating Life, or Spirit, concerning Itself is its simple awareness of its own being, and this, demanding a relationship to something else, produces a primary ether, a universal substance out of which everything in the world must grow.”</P>
<P class="p97 ft5">Troward also tells us that “though this awareness of being is a necessary foundation for any further possibilities, it is not much to talk about.” It is the same with individualized Spirit, which is yourself.</P>
<P class="p21 ft5">Before you can entertain the idea of making a mental picture of your desire as being at all practical, you must have some idea of your being; of your “I am”; and just as soon as you are conscious of your “I <NOBR>am”-ness,</NOBR> you begin to wish to enjoy the freedom which this consciousness suggests. You want to do more and be more, and as you fulfill this desire within yourself, localized spirit begins conscious activities in you. The thing you are more concerned with is the specific action of the Creative Spirit of Life, Universal Mind specialized. The localized <NOBR>God-germ</NOBR> in you~ is your personality, your individuality and since the joy of absolute freedom is the inherent nature of this <NOBR>God-germ,</NOBR> it is natural that it should endeavor to enjoy itself through its specific center. And as you grow in the comprehension that your being, your individuality, is God particularizing Himself, you naturally develop Divine tendencies. You want to enjoy life and liberty. You want freedom in your affairs as well as in your consciousness, and it is natural that you should.</P>
<P class="p98 ft5">With this progressive wish there is always a faint thought- picture. As your wish and your recognition grow into an intense desire, this desire becomes a clear mental picture. For example, a young lady studying music wishes she had a piano in order to practice at home. She wants the piano so much that she can mentally see it in one of the rooms. She holds the picture of the</P>

<P class="p62 ft5">piano and indulges in the mental reflection of the pleasure and advantage it will be to have the piano in the corner of the living room. One day she finds it there, just as she had pictured it.</P>
<P class="p99 ft5">As you grow in understanding as to who you are, where you came from, what the purpose of your being is, and how you are to fulfill the purpose for which you are intended, you will become a more and more perfect center through which the Creative Spirit of Life can enjoy itself. And you will realize that there can be but one creative process filling all space, which is the same in its potentiality whether universal or individual. Furthermore, all there is, whether on the plane of the visible or invisible, had its origin in the localized action of thought, or a mental picture, and this includes yourself, because you are Universal Spirit localized, and the same creative action is taking place through you.</P>
<P class="p95 ft5">Now you are no doubt asking yourself why there is so much sickness and misery in the world. If the same power and intelligence which brought the world into existence is in operation in the mind of man, why does it not manifest itself as strength joy, health and plenty? If one can have one’s desires fulfilled by simply making a mental picture of that desire, holding on to it with the will, and without anxiety, doing on the outward plane whatever seems necessary to bring the desire into fulfillment, then there seems no reason for the existence of sickness and poverty. Surely no one desires either.</P>
<P class="p100 ft5">The first reason is that few persons will take the trouble to inquire into the working principle of the Laws of Life. If they did, they would soon convince themselves that there is no necessity for the sickness and poverty which we see about us. They would realize that visualizing is a principle and not a fallacy. There are a few who have found it worth while to study this simple, though absolutely unfailing law, which will deliver them from bondage. However, the race as a whole is not willing to give the time required for the study. It is either too simple, or too difficult. They may make a picture of their desire with some little understanding of visualizing for a day or two, but more frequently it is for an hour or so.</P>

<P class="p101 ft5">If you will insist upon mentally seeing yourself surrounded by things and conditions as you wish them to be you will understand that the Creative Energy sends its substance in the direction indicated by the tendency of your thoughts. Herein lies the advantage of holding your thought in the form of a mental picture.</P>
<P class="p102 ft5">A man in the hardware business in New Jersey came to me in great distress. He would have to go into bankruptcy unless something happened in a fortnight. He said he had never heard of visualizing. I explained to him how to make a mental picture of his business increasing, instead of a picture of losing it. In about a month’s time he returned very happy and told me how he had succeeded. He said, “I have my debts all paid, and my shop is full of new supplies.” His business was then on a solid basis. It was beautiful to see his Faith.</P>
<P class="p46 ft5">The more enthusiasm and faith you are able to put into your picture, the more quickly it will come into visible form, and your enthusiasm is increased by keeping your desire secret. The moment you speak it to any living soul, that moment your power is weakened. Your power, your magnet of attraction is not that strong, and consequently cannot reach so far. The more perfectly a secret between your mind and your outer self is guarded, the more vitality you give your power of attraction. One tells one’s troubles to weaken them, to get them off one’s mind, and when a thought is given out, its power is dissipated. Talk it over with yourself, and even write it down, then destroy the paper.</P>
<P class="p103 ft5">However, this does not mean that you should strenuously endeavor to compel the Power to work out your picture on the special lines that you think it should. That method would soon exhaust you and hinder the fulfillment of your purpose. A wealthy relative need not necessarily die, or someone lose a fortune on the street, to materialize the $10,000 which you are mentally picturing.</P>
<P class="p92 ft5">One of the doormen in the building in which I lived heard much of the mental picturing of desires from visitors passing out of my rooms. The average desire was for $500. He considered that five</P>

My parrot flew out of the window, and I telephoned to the men in the courtyard to get it for me. One caught it, and it bit him on the finger. The doorman, who had gloves on, and did not fear a similar hurt, took hold of it and brought it up to me. I gave him five <NOBR>one-dollar</NOBR> bills for his service. This sudden reward surprised him. He enthusiastically told me that he had been visualizing for just $5, merely from hearing that others visualized. He was delighted at the unexpected realization of his mental picture.</P>
<P class="p46 ft5">All you have to do is to make such a mental picture of your heart’s desire, and hold it cheerfully in place with your will, always conscious that the same Infinite Power which brought the universe into existence brought you into form for the purpose of enjoying Itself in and through you. And since it is all Life, Love, Light, Power, Peace, Beauty, and Joy, and is the only Creative Power there is, the form it takes in and through you depends upon the direction given it by your thought. In you it is undifferentiated, waiting to take any direction given it as it passes through the instrument which it has made for the purpose of self- <NOBR>distribution—you.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p74 ft5">It is this Power which enables you to transfer your thoughts from one form to another. The power to change your mind is the individualized Universal Power taking the initiative, giving direction to the unformed substance contained in every thought. It is the simplest thing in the world to give this highly sensitive Substance any form you will, through visualizing. Anyone can do it with a small expenditure of effort.</P>
<P class="p92 ft5">Once you really believe that your mind is a center through which the unformed substance of all there is in your world, takes involuntary form, the only reason your picture does not always materialize is because you have introduced something antagonistic to the fundamental principle. Very often this destructive element is caused by the frequency with which you change your pictures. After many such changes, you decide that your original desire is what you want after all. Upon this conclusion, you begin to wonder why it (being your first picture)</P>

<P class="p0 ft4">has not materialized.</P>
<P class="p5 ft5">The Substance with which you are mentally dealing is more sensitive than the most sensitive photographer’s film. If, while taking a picture, you suddenly remembered you had already taken a picture on that same plate, you would not expect a perfect result of either picture. On the other hand, you may have taken two pictures on the same plate unconsciously. When the plate has been developed, and the picture comes into physical view, you do not condemn the principle of photography, nor are you puzzled to understand why your picture has turned out so unsatisfactorily. You do not feel that it is impossible for you to obtain a good, clear picture of the subject in question. You know that you can do so, by simply starting at the beginning, putting in a new plate, and determining to be more careful while taking your picture next time. If these lines are followed out, you are sure of a satisfactory result. If you will proceed in the same manner with your mental picture, doing your part in a correspondingly confident frame of mind, the result will be just as perfect. The laws of visualizing are as infallible as the laws governing photography. In fact, photography is the outcome of visualizing.</P>
<P class="p104 ft5">Again, your results in visualizing the fulfillment of your desires may be imperfect, and your desires delayed, through the misuse of this power, owing to the thought that the fulfillment of your desire is contingent upon certain persons or conditions. The Originating Principle is not in any way dependent upon any person, place, or thing. It has no past and knows no future. The law is that the Originating Creative Principle of Life is “the universal here and everlasting now.” It creates its own vehicles through which to operate. Therefore, past experience has no bearing upon your present picture. So do not try to obtain your desire through a channel which may not be natural for it, even though it may seem reasonable to you. Your feeling should be that the thing, or the consciousness, which you so much desire, is normal and natural, a part of yourself, a form of your evolution. If you can do this, there is no power to prevent your enjoying the fulfillment of the picture you have in mind, or any other you may create.</P>

<P class="p107 ft5">HUNDREDS of persons have realized that “visualizing is an Aladdin’s lamp to him with a mighty will.” General Foch says that his feelings were so outraged during the <NOBR>Franco-Prussian</NOBR> war in 1870 that he visualized himself leading a French army against the Germans to victory. He said he made his picture, smoked his pipe, and waited. This is one result of visualizing with which we are all familiar.</P>
<P class="p108 ft5">A famous actress wrote a long article in one of the leading Sunday papers last winter, describing how she rid herself of excessive avoirdupois by seeing her figure constantly as she wished to be.</P>
<P class="p109 ft5">A very interesting letter came to me from a doctor’s wife, while I was lecturing in New York. She began with the hope that I would never discontinue my lectures on visualization, which were helping humanity to realize the wonderful fact that they possessed the means of liberation within themselves. Relating her own experience, she said that she was born on the East Side of New York in the poorest quarter. From earliest girlhood she had cherished a dream of marrying a physician some day. This dream gradually formed a stationary mental picture. The first position she obtained was in the capacity of a maid in a physician’s family. Leaving this place, she entered the family of another doctor. The wife of her employer died, and the doctor married her <NOBR>—the</NOBR> result of <NOBR>long-pictured</NOBR> yearning. After that, both she and her husband conceived the idea of owning a fruit farm in the South. They formed a mental picture of the idea and put their faith in its eventual fulfillment. The letter she sent me came from her fruit farm in the South. Her second mental picture had seen the light of materialization.</P>
<P class="p110 ft5">Many letters of a similar nature come to me every day. The following is a case that was printed in the New York Herald last May: “Atlantic City, May <NOBR>5—She</NOBR> was an old woman, and when she was arraigned before Judge Clarence Goldenberg in the</P>

<P class="p8 ft5">In an issue of Good Housekeeping there was an article by Addington Bruce entitled “Stiffening Your Mental Backbone.” It is very instructive, and would benefit anyone to read it.

It would be possible to call your attention to hundreds of similar cases.</P>

<P class="p107 ft5">PERHAPS you want to feel that you’ve lived to some purpose. You want to be contented and happy; you feel that good health and a successful business would give you contentment. After you have decided once and for all that this is what you want, you proceed to picture yourself healthy, and your business just as great a success as you can naturally conceive it growing into. The best times for making your definite picture are just before breakfast, and again, before retiring at night. As it is necessary to give yourself plenty of time, it may be necessary to rise earlier than you usually do. Go into a room where you will not be disturbed, meditate for a few moments upon the practical working of the law of visualizing, and ask yourself, “How did the things about me first come into existence? How can I get more quickly in touch with my invisible supply?”</P>
<P class="p119 ft5">Someone felt that comfort would be better expressed and experienced by sitting on a chair than on the floor. So the very beginning of a chair was the desire to be at ease. With this came the picture of some sort of a chair. The same principle applies to the hat and the clothes you wear. Go carefully into the thought of the principle back of the thing. Establish it as a personal experience; make it a fact to your consciousness.</P>
<P class="p35 ft5">Then open a window, take about ten deep breaths, and during the time draw a large imaginary circle of light pound you.

As you do this, mentally see imaginary rays, or sprays, of light going up through the body, and down and out through feet. Mentally spray your entire body with this imaginary light. When you have finished the breathing exercise, sit in a comfortable upright chair and mentally know there is but one Life, one Substance, and this Life Substance of the Universe is finding pleasure in <NOBR>self-recognition</NOBR> in you. Repeat some affirmation of this kind, until you feel the truth and stimulating reality of the words which you are affirming. Then begin your picture.

You might change some of the furniture about and look into some of the mirrors just to see how healthy, wealthy, and happy you look. Go over your picture again and again, until you feel the reality of it, then write it all down just as you have seen it, with the feeling that:</P>

<P class="p128 ft5"><SPAN class="ft4">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">Visualizing brings your objective mind into a state of equilibrium, which enables you to consciously direct the flow of Spirit to a definitely recognized purpose, and to carefully guard your thoughts from including a flow in the opposite direction.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p129 ft5">wonderful potential energy, which is not yet differentiated into any particular form, and that by the action of your mind, you can differentiate it into any specific form that you will. Your picture assists you to keep your mind fixed on the fact that the inflow of this Creative Energy is taking place. Also, by your mental picture, you are determining the direction you wish the sensitive Creative Power to take, and by doing this, you make the externalization of your picture a certainty.</P>
<P class="p130 ft5"><SPAN class="ft4">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">Remember when you are visualizing properly that there is no strenuous effort to hold your </SPAN><NOBR>thought-forms</NOBR> in place.

<P class="p50 ft5"><SPAN class="ft4">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">By holding your picture in a cheerful frame of mind, you shut out all thoughts that would disperse or dissipate the spiritual nucleus of your picture.

<P class="p75 ft5">Remember always, that “Nature, from her clearly visible surface to her most arcane depths, is one vast storehouse of light and good entirely devoted to your individual use.” Your conscious Oneness with the great Whole is the secret of success, and when once you have fathomed this, you can enjoy your possession of the whole, or a part of it, at will, because by your recognition you have made it, and can increasingly make it, yours.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Never forget that every physical thing, whether for you or against you, was a sustained thought before it was a thing. Thought, as thought, is neither good nor bad; it is Creative Action and always takes physical form. Therefore, the thoughts you dwell upon become the things you possess or do not possess.</P>

<P class="p136 ft3">Why I Took Up the</P>
<P class="p137 ft3">Study of Mental Science</P>
<P class="p138 ft5">I HAVE frequently been questioned about my reasons for taking up the study of Mental Science, and as to the results of my search, not only in the knowledge of principles, but also in the application of that knowledge for the development of my own life.</P>
<P class="p25 ft5">Such inquiries are justifiable, because one who essays the role of a messenger of psychological truths can only be convincing as he or she has tested them in the laboratory of personal mental experience. This is particularly true in my case, as the only personal pupil of Judge Troward, the great Master in Mental Science, whose teaching is based upon the relation borne by the Individual Mind toward the Universal Creative Mind, which is the Giver of Life, and the manner in which that relation may be invoked to secure expansion and fuller expression in the individual life.</P>
<P class="p139 ft5">My initial impulse toward the study of Mental Science was an overwhelming sense of loneliness. In every life there must come some such experience of spiritual isolation as pervaded my life at that period. Notwithstanding the fact that each day found me in the midst of friends, surrounded by mirth and gaiety, there was a persistent feeling that I was alone in the world. I had been a widow for about three years, wandering from country to country, seeking for peace of mind.</P>
<P class="p140 ft5">The circumstances and surroundings of my life were such that my friends looked upon me as an unusually fortunate young woman. Although they recognized that I had sustained a great loss when my husband died, they knew that he had left me well provided for, free to go anywhere my pleasure dictated.</P>
<P class="p85 ft5">Yet, if my friends could have penetrated my inmost emotions, they would have found a deep sense of emptiness and isolation. This feeling inspired a spirit of unrest, which drove me on and on</P>

<P class="p141 ft4">in fruitless search upon the outside, for that which I later learned could only be found within.</P>
<P class="p91 ft5">I studied Christian Science, but it gave me no solace, though fully realizing the great work the Scientists were doing, and even having the pleasure and privilege of meeting Mrs. Eddy personally. But it was impossible for me to accept the fundamental teachings of Christian Science and make practical application of it.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">When about to abandon the search for contentment and resign myself to resume a life of apparent amusement, a friend invited me to visit the great Seer and Teacher, Abdul Baha. After my interview with this most wonderful of men, my search for contentment began to take a change. He had told me that I would travel the world over seeking the truth, and when I had found it, would speak it out. The fulfillment of the statement of this Great Seer then seemed to be impossible. But it carried a measure of encouragement, and at least indicated that my former seeking had been in the wrong direction. I began in a feeble groping way to find contentment within myself, for had he not intimated that I should find the truth? That was the big thing, and about the only thing I remember of our interview.</P>
<P class="p142 ft5">A few days later, upon visiting the office of a New Thought practitioner, my attention was attracted to a book on his table entitled “The Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science,” by T. Troward. It interested me to see that Troward was a retired Divisional Judge from the Punjab, India. I purchased the book, thinking I would read it through that evening. Many have endeavored to do the same thing, only to find, as I did, that the book must be studied in order to be understood, and hundreds have decided, just as I did, to give it their undivided attention. After finding this treasure book, I went to the country for a few days, and while there, studied the volume as thoroughly as I could.</P>
<P class="p143 ft5">It seemed extremely difficult, and I decided to purchase another book of Troward ‘s, in the hope that its study might not require so much of an effort. Upon inquiry I was told that a subsequent</P>

<DIV id="id33_1">
<P class="p101 ft5">volume, “The Dore Lectures,” was much the simpler and better of the two books. When I procured it, I found that it must also be studied. It took me weeks and months to get even a vague conception of the meaning of the first chapter of Dore, which is entitled “Entering Into the Spirit of It.” I mean by this that it took me months to enter into the spirit of what I was reading.</P>
<P class="p144 ft5">But in the meantime a paragraph from page 26 arrested my attention, as seeming the greatest thing I had ever read. I memorized it and endeavored with all my soul to enter into the spirit of Troward‘s words. The paragraph reads:</P>
<P class="p47 ft5">“My mind is a center of Divine operation. The Divine operation is always for expansion and fuller expression, and this means the production of something beyond what has gone before, something entirely new, not included in the past experience, though proceeding out of it by an orderly sequence or growth. Therefore, since the Divine cannot change its inherent nature, it must operate in the same manner with me; consequently, in my own special world, of which I am the center, it will move forward to produce new conditions, always in advance of any that have gone before.”</P>
<P class="p46 ft5">It took an effort on my part to memorize this paragraph, but in the endeavor toward this end, the words seemed to carry with them a certain stimulus. Each repetition of the paragraph made it easier for me to enter into the spirit of it. The words expressed exactly what I had been seeking for. My one desire was for peace of mind. I found it comforting believe that the Divine operation in me could expand to fuller expression and produce more and more <NOBR>contentment—in</NOBR> fact, a peace mind and a degree of contentment greater than I had ever known. The paragraph further inspired me with deep interest to feel that the <NOBR>life-spark</NOBR> in me could bring into my life something entirely new. I did not wish to obliterate my past experience, but that was exactly what Troward said it would not do. The Divine operation would not exclude my past experience, but proceeding out of it would bring some new things that would transcend anything that I had ever experienced before.</P>

<P class="p34 ft5">Meditation on these statements brought with it a certain joyous feeling. What a wonderful thing it would be if I could accept and sincerely believe, beyond all doubt, that this one statement of Troward‘s was true. Surely the Divine could not change its inherent nature, and since Divine life is operating in me, I must be Divinely inhabited, and the Divine in me must operate just as it operates upon the Universal plane. This meant that my whole world of circumstances, friends, and conditions would ultimately become a world of contentment and enjoyment of which “I am the center.” This would all happen just as soon as I was able to control my mind and thereby provide a concrete center around which the Divine energies could play.</P>
<P class="p145 ft5">Surely it was worth trying for. If Troward had found this truth, why not it the idea held me to my task. Later I determined to study with the man who had realized and given to the world so great a statement it had lifted me from my state of despondency. The immediate difficulty was the need for increased finances.</P>
<P class="p116 ft3">CHAPTER IX</P>
<P class="p146 ft3">How I Attracted to Myself Twenty</P>
<P class="p147 ft3">Thousand Dollars</P>
<P class="p148 ft5">IN the laboratory of experience in which my newly revealed relation to the Divine operation was to be tested, the first problem was a financial one. My income was a stipulated one quite enough for my everyday needs, but it did not seem sufficient to enable me to go comfortably to England, where Troward lived and remain for an indefinite period to study with so great a teacher as he must be.</P>
<P class="p149 ft5">So before inquiring whether Troward took pupils, or whether I would be eligible in case he did, I began to use the paragraph I had memorized. Daily, in fact, almost hourly, the words were in my mind: “My mind is a center of Divine operation, and Divine operation means expansion into something better than has gone before.”</P>

<P class="p150 ft5">Law of Attraction, and from the Chapter on “Causes and Conditions” I had gleaned a vague idea of visualizing. So every night, before going to sleep, I made a mental picture of the desired $20,000 which seemed necessary to go and study with Troward.</P>
<P class="p21 ft5">Twenty imaginary $1,000 bills were counted over each night in my bedroom, and then, with the idea of more emphatically impressing my mind with the fact that this twenty thousand dollars was for the purpose of going to England and studying with Troward, I wrote out my picture, saw myself buying my steamer ticket, walking up and down the ship’s deck from New York to London, and finally, saw myself accepted as Troward’s pupil. This process was repeated every morning and every evening, always impressing more and more fully upon my mind Troward‘s memorized statement: “My mind is a center of Divine operations.” I endeavored to keep this statement in the back part of my consciousness all the time, with no thought in mind of how the money might be obtained. Probably the reason why there was no thought of the avenues through which the money might reach me was because I could not possibly imagine where the $20,000 would come from. So I simply held my thought steady and let the power of attraction find its own ways and means.</P>
<P class="p151 ft5">One day while walking on the street, taking deep breathing exercises, the thought came:</P>
<P class="p152 ft5">“My mind is surely a center of Divine operation. If God fills all space, then God must be in my mind also; if I want this money to study with Troward that I may know the truth of Life, then both the money and the truth must be mine, though I am unable to feel or see the physical manifestations of either. Still,” I declared, “it must be mine.”</P>
<P class="p31 ft5">While these reflections were going on in my mind, there seemed to come up from within me the thought: “I Am all the substance there is. Then, from another channel in my brain the answer seemed to come, “Of course, that’s it; everything must have its beginning in mind. The idea must contain within itself the only one and primary substance there is, and this means money as</P>

</DIV>

<DIV id="page_36">


<DIV id="id36_1">
<P class="p153 ft4">well as everything else.” My mind accepted this idea, and immediately all the tension of mind and body was relaxed.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">There was a feeling of absolute certainty of being in touch with all the power Life has to give. All thought of money, teacher, or even my own personality, vanished in the great wave of joy which swept over my entire being. I walked on and on, with this feeling of joy steadily increasing and expanding until everything about me seemed aglow with resplendent light. Every person I passed appeared illuminated as I was. All consciousness of personality had disappeared, and in its place there came that great and almost overwhelming sense of joy and contentment.</P>
<P class="p154 ft5">That night when I made my picture of the twenty thousand dollars it was with an entirely changed aspect. On previous occasions, when making my mental picture, I had felt that I was waking up something within myself. This time there was no sensation of effort. I simply counted over the twenty thousand dollars. Then, in a most unexpected manner, from a source of which I had no consciousness at the time, there seemed to open a possible avenue through which the money might reach me.</P>
<P class="p155 ft5">At first it took great effort not to be excited. It all seemed so wonderful, so glorious, to be in touch with supply. But had not Troward cautioned his readers to keep all excitement out of their minds in the first flush of realization of union with Infinite supply, and to treat this fact as a perfectly natural result which had been reached through our demand? This was even more difficult for me than it was to hold the thought that “all the substance there is, I Am; I (idea) Am the beginning of all form, visible or invisible.”</P>
<P class="p75 ft5">Just as soon as there appeared a circumstance which indicated the direction through which the twenty thousand dollars might come, I not only made a supreme effort to regard the indicated direction calmly as the first sprout of the seed I had sown in the absolute, but left no stone unturned to follow up that direction, thereby fulfilling my part. By so doing, one circumstance seemed naturally to lead to another, until, step by step, my desired twenty thousand dollars was secured. To keep my mind poised and free</P>

<P class="p0 ft4">from excitement was my greatest effort.</P>
<P class="p128 ft5">This first concrete fruition of my study of Mental Science as expounded by Troward’s book had come by a careful following of the methods he had outlined. In this connection, therefore I can offer to the reader no better gift than to quote Troward’s book, “The Edinburgh Lectures,” from which may be derived a complete idea of the line of action I was endeavoring to follow. In the chapter on Causes and Conditions he says:</P>
<P class="p27 ft5">“To get good results we must properly understand our relation to the great impersonal power we are using. It is intelligent, and we are intelligent, and the two intelligences must <NOBR>co-operate.”</NOBR> We must not fly in the face of the law expecting it to do for us what it can only do through us; and we must therefore use our intelligence with the knowledge that it is acting as the instrument of a greater intelligence; and because we have this knowledge we may and should cease from all anxiety as to the final result.</P>
<P class="p85 ft5">“In actual practice we must first form the ideal conception of our object with the definite intention of impressing it upon the Universal <NOBR>Mind—it</NOBR> is this thought that takes such thought out of the region of mere casual fancies and then affirm that our knowledge of the Law is sufficient reason for a calm expectation of a corresponding result, and that therefore all necessary conditions will come to us in due order. We can then turn to the affairs of our daily life with the calm assurance that the initial conditions are either there already or will soon come into view. If we do not at once see them, let us rest content with the knowledge that the spiritual prototype is already in existence and wait till some circumstance pointing in the desired direction begins to shop itself. It may be a very small circumstance, but it is the direction and not the magnitude which is to be taken into consideration.</P>
<P class="p156 ft5">As soon as we see it we should regard it as the first sprouting of the seed sown in the Absolute, and do calmly, and without excitement, whatever the circumstances seem to require, and then later on we shall see that this doing will in turn lead to a further circumstance in the same direction, until we find ourselves</P>

<P class="p84 ft5">conducted, step by step, to the accomplishment of our object. In this way the understanding of the great principle of the Law of Supply will, by repeated experiences, deliver us more and more completely out of the region of anxious thought and toilsome labor and bring us into a new world where the useful employment of all our powers, whether mental or physical, will only be an unfolding of our individuality upon the lines of its own nature, and therefore a perpetual source of health and happiness; a sufficient inducement, surely, to the careful study of the laws governing the relation on between the individual and the Universal Mind.”</P>
<P class="p139 ft5">To my mind, then as now, this quotation outlines the core and center of the method and manner of approach necessary for coming in touch with Infinite Supply. At least it, together with the previously quoted statement, “My mind is a center of Divine operation,” etc., constituted the only apparent means of attracting to myself the twenty thousand dollars. My constant endeavor to get into the spirit of these statements, and to attract to myself this needed sum, took about six weeks, at the end of which time I had in my bank the required twenty thousand dollars. This could be made into a long story, giving all the details, but the facts, as already narrated, will give you a definite idea of the magnetic condition of my mind while the twenty thousand dollars was finding its way to me.</P>
<P class="p157 ft3">CHAPTER X</P>
<P class="p158 ft3">How I Became The Only Personal Pupil</P>
<P class="p159 ft3">of Thomas Troward,</P>
<P class="p160 ft3">The Great Mental Scientist</P>
<P class="p51 ft5">AS soon as the idea of studying with Troward came to me, I asked a friend to write him for me, feeling that perhaps my friend could couch my desire in better or more persuasive terms than I could employ. To all the letters written by this friend, I received not one reply. This was so discouraging that I would have completely abandoned the idea of becoming Troward‘s pupil, except for the experience I had had that day on the street, when my whole world was illuminated, and I remembered the promise</P>

<DIV id="id39_1">
<P class="p62 ft4">“All things whatsoever thou wilt, believe thou hast received, and thou shalt receive.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">With this experience in my mind, my passage to England was arranged, notwithstanding the fact that apparently my letters were ignored. We wrote again, however, and finally received a reply, very courteous though very positive. Troward did not take pupils; he had no time to devote to a pupil. Notwithstanding this definite decision, I declined to be discouraged, because of the memory of my experience upon the day when the light and the thought had come to me, “I Am all the Substance there is.” I seemed to be able to live that experience over at will, and with it there always came a flood of courage and renewed energy. We journeyed on to London, and from there telegraphed Troward, asking for an interview. The telegram was promptly answered, setting a date when he could see us.</P>
<P class="p161 ft5">At this time Troward was living in Ruan Manor, a little <NOBR>out-of-</NOBR> <NOBR>the-way</NOBR> place in the Southern part of England, about twenty miles from a railway station. We could not find it on the map, and with great difficulty Cook’s Touring Agency, in London, located the place for us. There was very little speculation in my mind as to what Troward would say to me in this interview. There always remained the feeling that the truth was mine; also that it would grow and expand in my consciousness until peace and contentment were outward, as well as inward, manifestations of my individual life.</P>
<P class="p162 ft5">We arrived at Troward‘s house in a terrific rainstorm, and were cordially received by Troward himself, whom I found, much to my surprise, to be more the type of a Frenchman than an Englishman, (I afterward learned that he was a descendant of the Huguenot race), a man of medium stature, with a rather large head, big nose, and eyes that fairly danced with merriment.</P>
<P class="p92 ft5">After we had been introduced to the other members of the family and given a cup of hot tea, we were invited into the <NOBR>living-room,</NOBR> where Troward talked very freely of everything except my proposed studies. It seemed quite impossible to bring him to that subject. Just before we were leaving, however, I asked quite</P>

<DIV id="page_40">


<DIV id="id40_1">
<P class="p163 ft5">boldly: “Will you not reconsider your decision to take a personal pupil? I wish so much to study with you,” to which he replied, with a very indifferent manner, that he did not feel he could give the time it would require for personal instruction, but that he would be glad to give me the names of two or three books which he felt would not only be interesting but instructive to me.</P>
<P class="p75 ft5">He said he felt much flattered and pleased that I had come all the way from America to study with him, and as we walked out through the lane from his house to our automobile, his manner became less indifferent, a feeling of sympathy seemed to touch his heart, and he turned to me with the remark: “You might write to me, if so inclined, after you get to Paris, and perhaps, if I have time in the autumn, we could arrange something, though it does not seem possible now.”</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">I lost no time in following up his very kind invitation to write. My letters were all promptly and courteously answered, but there was never a word of encouragement as to my proposed studies. Finally, about two months later, there came a letter with this question in it: “What do you suppose is the meaning of this verse in the 21st Chapter of Revelation?”</P>
<P class="p164 ft9">“16. And the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.”</P>
<P class="p165 ft5">Instinctively I knew that my chance to study with Troward hung upon my giving the correct answer to that question. The definition of the verse seemed utterly beyond my reach. Naturally, answers came to my mind, but I knew intuitively that they were incorrect. I began bombarding my scholarly friends and acquaintances with the same questions. Lawyers, doctors, priests, nuns, and clergymen, all over the world, received letters from me with this question in them. Answers began to return to me, but intuition told me not one was correct.</P>
<P class="p162 ft4">All the while I was endeavoring to find the answer for myself, but no answer came. I memorized the verse in order that I might</P>

<DIV id="id41_1">
<P class="p0 ft5">meditate upon it. I began a search of Paris for the books Troward had recommended to me, and after two or three days’ search we crossed the River Seine to the fle de Cite to go into some of the old bookstores there. The books were out of print, and these were the last places in which to find them. Finally we came upon a little shop which had them. The man had only one copy of each left, consequently the price was high. While remonstrating with the clerk, my eye rested upon the work of an astrologer, which I laughingly picked up and asked: “Do you think Prof.— would read my horoscope?” The clerk looked aghast at the suggestion, and responded, “Why, no, Madame, he is one of France’s greatest astrologers. He does not read horoscopes.”</P>
<P class="p166 ft5">In spite of this answer, there was a persistent impulse within me to go to the man. The friend who had accompanied me in my search for the books remonstrated with me, and tried in every way to dissuade me from going to the famous astrologer, but I insisted. When we arrived at his office, I found it somewhat embarrassing to ask him to read my horoscope. Nevertheless, there was nothing to do but put the question. Reluctantly, the Professor invited us into his <NOBR>paper-strewn</NOBR> study; reluctantly, and also impatiently he asked us to be seated. Very courteously and coldly he told me that he did not read horoscopes. His whole manner said, more clearly than words could, that he wished we would take our departure.</P>
<P class="p167 ft5">My friend stood up. I was at a great loss what to do next, because I felt that I was not quite ready to go. Intuition seemed to tell me there was something for me to gain there. Just what it was I was unable to define, so I paused a moment, much to my friend’s displeasure and embarrassment, when one of the Professor’s enormous Persian cats jumped into my lap. “Get down, Jack!” the Professor shouted. “What does it mean?” he seemed to ask himself. Then with a greater interest than he had hitherto shown in me, the Professor said with a smile:</P>
<P class="p100 ft5">“I have never known that cat to go to a stranger before, Madame; my cat pleads for you. I, also, now feel an interest in your horoscope, and if you will give me the data it will give me pleasure to write it out for you."</P>

</DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_42">


<DIV id="id42_1">
<P class="p168 ft10">There was a great feeling of happiness in me when he made this statement, which he concluded by saying, “I do not feel that you really care for your horoscope.” The truth of this statement shocked me, because I did not care about a horoscope, and could not give any reason why I was letting him do it. “However,” he said, “may I call for your data next Sunday afternoon?”</P>
<P class="p169 ft5">On Sunday afternoon at the appointed time, the Professor arrived, and I was handing him the slip of paper with all the data of my birth, etc., when the idea came to ask the Professor the answer to the question Troward had given me from the 16th verse of the 21st Chapter of Revelation. The thought was instantly carried into effect, and I found myself asking this man what he thought this verse meant. Without pausing to think it over, he immediately replied, “It means: the city signifies the truth, and the truth is <NOBR>non-invertible;</NOBR> every side from which you approach it is exactly the same.” Intuitively and undoubtingly I recognized this answer as the true one, and my joy knew no bounds, because I felt sure that with this correct answer in my possession, Troward would accept me as his pupil in the fall.</P>
<P class="p170 ft5">As the great astrologer was leaving, I explained to him all about my desire to study with Troward, how I had come from New York City for that express purpose, seemingly to no avail, until the answer to this test question had been given to me by him. He was greatly interested and asked many questions about Troward, and when asked if he would please send me his bill, he smilingly replied, “Let me know if the great Troward accepts you as his pupil,” and bade me good afternoon. I hastened to my room to send a telegram to Troward, giving my answer to the question from the 16th verse of the 21st Chapter of Revelation.</P>
<P class="p171 ft5">There was an immediate response from Troward which said: “Your answer is correct. Am beginning a course of lectures on The Great Pyramid in London. If you wish to attend them, will be pleased to have you, and afterward, if you still wish to study with me, I think it can be arranged.” On receipt of this reply preparations were at once made to leave Paris for London.</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">I attended all the lectures, receiving much instruction from them,</P>

<P class="p172 ft11">31 Stanwick Road,</P>
<P class="p18 ft11">W. Kensington, England.</P>
<P class="p37 ft11">Dear Mrs. Behrend:</P>
<P class="p6 ft12">I think I had better write you a few lines with regard to your proposed studies with me, as I should be sorry for you to be under any misapprehension and so to suffer any disappointment.</P>
<P class="p173 ft13">I have studied the subject now for several years, and have a general acquaintance with the leading features of most of the systems which, unfortunately, occupy attention in many circles at the present time, such as Theosophy, The Tarot, The Kabala, and the like, and I have no hesitation in saying that, to the best of my judgment, all sorts and descriptions of <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> occult study are in direct opposition to the real <NOBR>life-giving</NOBR> Truth, and therefore, you must not expect any teaching on such lines as these.</P>
<P class="p174 ft9">We hear a great deal these days about initiation; but, believe me, the more you try to become a <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> “Initiate” the further you will put yourself from living life.</P>
<P class="p175 ft9">I speak after many years of careful study and consideration when I say that the Bible and its Revelation of Christ is the one thing really worth studying, and that is a subject large enough in all conscience, embracing, as it does, our outward life and of everyday concerns, and also the inner springs of our life and all that we can in general terms conceive of the life in the unseen after putting off the body at death.</P>
<P class="p176 ft12">You have expressed a very great degree of confidence in my teaching, and if your confidence is such that you wish, as you say, to put yourself entirely under my guidance, I can only accept it as a very serious responsibility, and should have to ask you to exhibit that confidence by refusing to look into such <NOBR>so-called</NOBR></P>

<P class="p62 ft9">“Mysteries” as I would forbid you to look into. I am speaking from experience; but the result will be that much of my teaching will appear to be very simple, perhaps to some extent dogmatic, and you will say you have heard much of it before.</P>
<P class="p21 ft9">Faith in God, Prayer and Worship, approach to the Father through <NOBR>Christ—all</NOBR> this is in a certain sense familiar to you; and all I can hope to do is perhaps to throw a little more light on these subjects, that they may become to you, not merely traditional words, but present living facts.</P>
<P class="p48 ft9">I have been thus explicit as I do not want you to have any disappointment, and also I should say that our <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> course of study will be only friendly conversations at such times as we can fit them in, either you coming to our house, or I to yours, as may be most convenient at the time.</P>
<P class="p177 ft11">Also, I will lend you some books which will be helpful, but they are very few, and in no sense occult.</P>
<P class="p178 ft9">Now, if all this falls in with your ideas, we shall, I am sure, be very glad to see you at Ruan Manor, and you will find that the residents there, though few, are very friendly and the neighborhood very pretty.</P>
<P class="p179 ft9">But, on the other hand, if you feel that you want some other source of learning, do not mind saying so, only you will never find any substitute for Christ.</P>
<P class="p180 ft9">I trust you will not mind my writing you like this, but I do not want you to come all the way down to Cornwall, and then be disappointed.</P>

<P class="p182 ft3">CHAPTER XI</P>
<P class="p183 ft3">How To Bring The Power In Your Word</P>
<P class="p184 ft3">Into Action</P>
<P class="p107 ft5">IN every word you use, there is a power germ which expands and projects itself in the direction your word indicates, and ultimately develops into physical expression. For example, you wish the consciousness of joy. Repeat the word “joy” secretly, persistently and emphatically. The repetition of the word joy sets up a quality of vibration which causes the joy germ to begin to expand and project itself until your whole being is filled with joy. This is not a mere fancy, but a truth. Once you experience this power, you will daily prove to yourself that these facts have not been fabricated to fit a theory, but the theory has been built up by careful observation of facts. Everyone knows that joy comes from within. No one can give it to you. Another may give you cause for joy, but no one can be joyous for you. Joy is a state of consciousness, and consciousness is purely mental.</P>
<P class="p185 ft5">Troward says the “Mental faculties always work under something which stimulates them, and this stimulus may come either from without, through the external senses, or from within, by the consciousness of something not perceptible on the physical plane. The recognition of this interior source of stimulus enables you to bring into your consciousness any state you desire.” Once a thing seems normal to you, it is as surely yours, through the Law of growth and attraction, as it is yours to know addition after you have learned the use of figures.</P>
<P class="p44 ft5">This method of repeating the word makes the word in all of its limitless meaning yours, because words are the embodiment of thoughts, and thought is creative; neither good nor bad, simply creative. This is the reason why Faith builds up and Fear destroys. “Only believe, and all things are possible unto you.” It is Faith that gives you dominion over every adverse circumstance or condition. It is your word of Faith that sets you free; not faith in any specific thing or act, but simple Faith in your best self in all ways. It is this <NOBR>ever-present</NOBR> Creative Power within the heart of the word that makes your health, your peace of mind, and your financial condition a reproduction of your most habitual thought.</P>

<P class="p187 ft3">How To Increase Your Faith</P>
<P class="p188 ft4">BUT you ask, “How can I speak the word of Faith when I have little or no faith?”</P>
<P class="p82 ft5">Every living thing has faith in something or somebody. Faith is that quality of Power which gives the Creative Energy a corresponding vitality, and the vitality in the word of Faith you use causes it to take corresponding physical form. Even intense fear is alive with faith. You fear smallpox because you believe it possible for you to contract it. You fear poverty and loneliness because you believe them possible for you. It is the Faith which understands that every creation had its birth in the womb of <NOBR>thought-words,</NOBR> that gives you dominion over all things, your lesser self included, and this feeling of faith is increased and intensified through observing what it does.</P>
<P class="p139 ft5">Your constant observation should be of your state of consciousness when you did; not when you hoped you might, but feared it was too good to be true. How did you feel that time when you simply had to bring yourself into a better frame of mind and did, or you had to have a certain thing and got it? Live these experiences over again and <NOBR>again—mentally—until</NOBR> you really feel in touch with the self which knows and does, and then the best there is, is yours.</P>
<P class="p189 ft3">CHAPTER XIII</P>
<P class="p190 ft3">The Reward of Increased Faith</P>
<P class="p138 ft5">YOUR desire to be your best has expanded your faith into the faith of the Universe which knows no failure, and has brought you into conscious realization that you are not a victim of the universe, but a part of it. Consequently you are able to recognize</P>

<P class="p84 ft5">that there is that within yourself which is able to make conscious contact with the Universal Law, and enables you to press all the particular laws of Nature, whether visible or invisible, into serving your particular demand or desire. Thereby you find yourself Master, not a slave, of any situation. Troward tells us that this Mastering is to be “accomplished by knowledge, and the only knowledge which will afford this purpose in all its measureless immensity is the knowledge of the personal element in universal spirit,” and its reciprocity to our own personality. In other words, the words you think, the personality you feel yourself to be, are all reproductions in miniature of God, “or specialized universal spirit.” All your <NOBR>word-thoughts</NOBR> were God <NOBR>word-forms</NOBR> before they were yours.</P>
<P class="p191 ft5">The words you use are the <NOBR>instruments—channels—through</NOBR> which the creative energy takes form. Naturally, this sensitive Creative Power can only reproduce in accordance with the instrument through which it passes. All disappointments and failures are the result of endeavoring to think one thing and produce another. This is just as impossible as it would be for an electric fan to be used for lighting purposes, or for water to flow through a crooked pipe in a straight line. The water must take the shape of the pipe through which it flows. Even more truly this sensitive, invisible Substance must reproduce outwardly the shape of the <NOBR>thought-word</NOBR> through which it passes. This is the law of its Nature; therefore, it logically follows, “As a man thinketh, so is he.”</P>
<P class="p119 ft5">Hence, when your thought or <NOBR>word-form</NOBR> is in correspondence with the Eternal constructive and forward movement of the Universal Law, then your mind is the mirror in which the Infinite Power and Intelligence of the Universe sees itself reproduced, and your individual life becomes one of harmony.</P>

<P class="p120 ft5">and infinitely sensitive and responsive. The responsiveness of its nature is <NOBR>two-fold:</NOBR> it is creative, and amenable to suggestion. Once the human understanding grasps this <NOBR>all-important</NOBR> fact, it realizes the simplicity with which the law of life supplies your every demand.</P>
<P class="p51 ft5">All that is necessary is to realize that your mind is a center of Divine operation, and consequently contains that within itself which accepts suggestions, and expect all life to respond to your call. Then you will find suggestions which tend to the fulfillment of your desire coming to you, not only from your fellowmen, but also from the flowers, the grass, the trees, and the rocks, which will enable you to fulfill your heart’s desire, if you act upon them in confidence on this physical plane.</P>

<P class="p197 ft3">Faith with Works –</P>
<P class="p198 ft3">What It has Accomplished</P>
<P class="p41 ft5">IT is said of Tyson, the great Australian Millionaire, that the suggestion to “make the desert land of Australia blossom as the rose” came to him from a modest little Australian violet while he was working as a bushman for something like three shillings a day.</P>
<P class="p58 ft5">He used to find these friendly little violets growing in certain places in the woods, and something in the flower touched something akin to itself in the mind of Tyson. He would sit on the side of his bunk at night and wonder how flowers and vegetable life could be given an opportunity to express themselves in the desert land of Australia. No doubt he realized that it would take a long time to save enough money to put irrigating ditches in the desert lands, but his thought and feeling assured him it could be accomplished, and if it could be done, he could do it.</P>

<DIV id="page_49">


<DIV id="id49_1">
<P class="p199 ft5">If there was a power within himself which was able to capture the idea, then there must be a responsive power within the idea itself which could bring itself into a practical physical manifestation. He resolutely put aside all questions as to the specific ways and means which would be employed in bringing his desire into physical manifestation, and simply kept his thought centered upon the idea of making fences and seeing flowers and grass where none existed at that time.</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Since the responsiveness of Reproductive Creative Power is not limited to any local condition of mind, his habitual meditation and mental picture set his ideas free to roam in infinitude, and attract to themselves other ideas of a kindred nature. Therefore, it was not necessary for Tyson to wait until he had saved from his three shillings a day enough money to irrigate the land, to see his ideas and desires fulfilled, for his ideas found other ideas in the financial world which were attuned in sympathy with themselves, and doors of finance were quickly opened.</P>
<P class="p200 ft5">All charitable institutions are maintained upon the principle of the responsiveness of life. If this were not true, no one would care to give, simply because another needed. The law of demand and supply, cause and effect, can never be broken. Ideas attract to themselves kindred ideas. Sometimes they come from a flower, a book, or out of the invisible. You are intent upon an idea not quite complete as to the ways and means of fulfillment, and behold along comes another idea, from no one can tell where, and find friendly lodging with your idea; one idea attracting another, and so on until your desires are physical facts.</P>
<P class="p201 ft5">You may feel the necessity for improvement in your finances, and wonder how this increase is to be brought about, when there seems suddenly to come from within the idea itself, the realization that <NOBR>everything—even</NOBR> <NOBR>money—had</NOBR> its birth in thought, and your thoughts turn their course. You simply hold to the statement or affirmation that the best, and all there is, is yours. Since you are able to capture ideas from the Infinite through the instrument of your intuition, you let your mind rest upon that thought, knowing full well that this very thought will respond to itself. Your inhibition of all doubt and anxiety enables</P>

<P class="p202 ft5">the reassuring ideas to establish themselves and attract to them “I can” and “I will” ideas, which gradually grow into the physical form of the desire in your mind.</P>
<P class="p203 ft5">In the conscious uses of the Universal Power to reproduce your desires in physical form, three facts should be borne in mind:</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><NOBR>First—All</NOBR> space is filled with a Creative Power.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4"><NOBR>Second—This</NOBR> Creative Power is amenable to suggestion.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4"><NOBR>Third—It</NOBR> can only work by deductive methods.</P>
<P class="p51 ft5">As Troward tells us, this last is an exceedingly important point, for it implies that the action of the <NOBR>ever-present</NOBR> Creative Power is in no way limited by precedent. It works according to the essence of the spirit of the principle. In other words, this Universal Power takes its creative direction from the word you give it. Once man realizes this great truth, the character with which this sensitive, reproductive power is invested becomes the most important of all his considerations. It is the unvarying law of Creative Life Principle that “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” If you realize the truth that the Creafive Power can be to you only what you feel and think it to be, it is willing and able to meet your demands.</P>
<P class="p204 ft4">Troward says, “If you think your thought is Powerful, your Thought is Powerful.”</P>
<P class="p36 ft5">“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he” is the law of life, and the Creative Power can no more change this law than an ordinary mirror can reflect back to you a different image than the object you hold before it. “As you think, so are you” does not mean “as you tell people you think,” or “as you would wish the world to believe you think.” It means your innermost thoughts; that place where no one but you know. “None can know the Father save the son,” and “No one can know the son but the Father.”</P>

Then everyone with whom you come into contact may know, because the Father, the Intelligent Creative Energy which heareth in secret your most secret thoughts, rewards you openly reproduces your thoughts in physical form. “As you think, that is what you become” should be kept in the background of your mind constantly. This is watching and praying without ceasing, and when you are not feeling quite up to par physically, pray.</P>

<P class="p41 ft4">Five o’clock in the morning is the best time to go into this sort of meditation.</P>
<P class="p211 ft5">If you will retire early every night for one month, and before falling asleep, impress firmly upon your subjective mind the affirmation: “My Father is the ruler of all the world, and is expressing His directing power through me,” you will find that the substance of life takes form in your thought molds. Do not accept the above suggestion simply because it is given to you. Think it over carefully until the impression is made upon your own subconscious mind understandingly.</P>
<P class="p67 ft5">Rise every morning, as was suggested before, at five o’clock, sit in a quiet room in a <NOBR>straight-back</NOBR> chair, and think out the affirmation of the previous evening, and you will realize and be able to put into practice your Princely Power with the realization to some extent, at least, that your mind really is a center through which all the Creative Energy and Power there is, is taking form.</P>

<P class="p213 ft11">The Principle Underlying Scientific Prayer</P>
<P class="p107 ft5">In prayer for a change in condition, physical, mental, or financial, for yourself or another, bear in mind that the fundamental necessity for the answer to prayer is the understanding of the scientific statement:</P>
<P class="p214 ft11">“Ask, believing you have already received, And you shall</P>
<P class="p215 ft11">receive”</P>
<P class="p216 ft5">This is not as difficult as it appears on the surface, once you realize that:</P>
<P class="p217 ft4">Everything has, its origin in the mind, and that which you seek outwardly, you already possess.</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">No one can think a thought in the future.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">Your thought of a thing constitutes its origin.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">THEREFORE:</P>
<P class="p218 ft11">The Thought Form of the Thing is already Yours</P>
<P class="p219 ft11">As soon as you think it.</P>
<P class="p220 ft5">Your steady recognition of this Thought Possession causes the thought to concentrate, to condense, to project itself, and to assume physical form.</P>
<P class="p221 ft11">To Get Rich Through Creation</P>

<P class="p223 ft11">Yourself or Another</P>
<P class="p224 ft5">(Remember that that which you call treatment or prayer is not, in any sense, hypnosis. It should never be your endeavor to take possession of the mind of another.)</P>
<P class="p194 ft5">Remember that it should never be your intention to make yourself believe that which you know to be untrue. You are simply thinking into God or First Cause with the understanding that:</P>
<P class="p225 ft5">“If a thing is true at all, there is a way in which it is true throughout the universe.” Remember that the power of thought works by absolutely scientific principles. These principles are expressed in the language of the statement:</P>
<P class="p226 ft5">“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” This statement contains a world of wisdom, but man’s steady recognition and careful application of the statement itself is required to bring it into practical use.</P>
<P class="p59 ft5">Remember that the principles involved in being as we think in our heart are elucidated and revealed by the law: “As you sow, so shall you reap”. Remember that your freedom to choose just what you will think, just what thought possession you will affirm and claim, constitutes God’s gift to you.</P>
<P class="p27 ft5">It shows how First Cause has endowed every man with the power and ability to bring into his personal environment whatever he chooses.</P>

<P class="p128 ft5">You are affirming this fact, believing that since you are thinking this, it is already yours.

<P class="p264 ft3">The Secret of “Doing without Doing”</P>
<P class="p265 ft4">By Dr. Robert Anthony</P>
<P class="p266 ft9">This is a very interesting article by Dr. Robert Anthony, the author of “Rapid Manifestation”. He explains to us why when we focus on the DOING, we are ultimately sabotaging our own effort. He then shows you how to create effortlessly.</P>
<P class="p267 ft5">One of the mistaken certainties or misconceptions most people operate under is that you get what you want in life by what you DO, or through the actions you take. Most people believe that the DOING or action part is what makes things happen. However, this causes you to create in reverse.</P>
<P class="p268 ft4">Let me explain.</P>
<P class="p269 ft5">The reason we put a lot of emphasis on action is because we do not understand the power of our thought. If you analyze it, 90% of most people’s actions are spent trying to compensate for inappropriate thought.</P>
<P class="p270 ft5">The Chinese philosopher <NOBR>Lao-tzu</NOBR> said that, “In the practice of the Way, every day something is dropped. Less and less do you need to force things until finally you arrive at non action. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone”. What he is talking about is doing without doing.</P>
<P class="p271 ft5">The problem is that most of us are preoccupied with “doing”. Unfortunately most of our doing usually involves struggle. In the western world we are conditioned to be <NOBR>action-oriented,</NOBR> so we place a tremendous value on doing. We are so busy doing that we do not realize that all this “doingness” causes us to create in a reverse fashion. Most of our actions are out of fear, worry or doubt because we believe nothing will get done unless we DO something. In other words, we are trying to force our desire into manifestation through action.</P>

<P class="p273 ft5">If your decision to DO is dominant, then you will not focus on what you want to BE in the present moment. This causes you to miscreate because BEING is the first and most important step in the creative process.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Here is the secret:</P>
<P class="p194 ft5">It is not your action that makes things happen, it is your intent. You can reduce the need for action to a very minimum by allowing yourself to focus on what you desire until you feel the positive energy begin to move within you. This energy is not based on doubt, fear, anxiety, worry or need. If you focus on what you want instead of what you don’t want, you will know when it is time to take action. And when you do, it will be effortless. Doors open and the entire universe will conspire to assist you in your desire.</P>
<P class="p44 ft5">Put simply, you should take no action on anything until you have visualized your desire and made it real enough in your mind that your next action (step), whatever it is, seems like the most logical step.</P>
<P class="p107 ft5">How can you know the next logical step? Here is the test that you can give to yourself before taking any action. If you focus on what you desire and still feel overwhelmed or anxious, then you are not ready for any action. You know you are ready when it feels like the next logical step is effortless. There is no effort, no strain, and no pain.</P>
<P class="p274 ft5">What we want to do is to use the leverage of energy, the same leverage of energy that creates everything in the universe. However, we are so caught up in the reality of WHAT IS, that we feel we must create everything through mental effort and physical activity.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">How to Effortlessly Attract the Wonderful Things In Life</P>
<P class="p69 ft5">Have you ever seen people who seem to have all the wonderful things in their life without much effort? It almost seems like they have an advantage over everyone else. Then you see the people</P>

<P class="p275 ft4">who work the hardest usually have the least. That doesn’t seem fair does it? But that’s the way the universe works.</P>
<P class="p29 ft5">Unfortunately, those who work the hardest usually have the least because they haven’t learned the leverage of aligning their energy. They are going about creating their lives the hard way. They are trying to use their actions to create what they want.</P>
<P class="p8 ft5">We have also been programmed that in order to have what we desire we must work hard. How many times have you heard - “No pain, no gain.” The implication is that if you want to make something of yourself, you must work hard. The message is clear</P>
<P class="p276 ft4"><SPAN class="ft4">-</SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">if you are not hurting or struggling, you are not moving forward.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p277 ft5">But here is the truth - anytime you are struggling you are miscreating. Anytime you feel pain or struggle, your magnetic point of attraction is directed to that which you do not want, rather than to that which you desire. Read it again!</P>
<P class="p278 ft3">Action is the Last Step in the Creation Process</P>
<P class="p107 ft5">Actions are necessary, but they are the last component of the creation processes. Actions cannot be used effectively to initiate results, because initiation is the function of BEING, then thought, then action.</P>
<P class="p41 ft5">Remember, the creation of anything is through your vibration. Everything vibrates, and it is by that vibration that we harmonize and attract experiences to ourselves. So before you act or do anything, first ask yourself, how am I vibrating? How do you tell? You tell by how you FEEL. Your feelings show you your vibration. How you feel determines what you attract.</P>
<P class="p36 ft5">When you use the process of creating by only focusing on what you want instead of what you don’t want, you will see that the universe will provide a different set of circumstances for you that requires much less action. This puts you in a state of “doing without doing” or action without effort.</P>

<P class="p280 ft3">Watch What You Think About</P>
<P class="p281 ft4">By Terry Goss</P>
<P class="p282 ft13">One of the biggest problems with our way of living is in not being careful about what we think. The thoughts that come and go in our mind affect us more than we realized. This article by Terry Goss, the author of “52 Mind Power Secrets” tells you why.</P>
<P class="p233 ft5">Don't be a sloppy thinker. Realize you're launching a force. A force that can work for good or evil. Thought power. Knowing this, don't just loosely give birth to thoughts. Also, don't dwell and linger on unwholesome evil thoughts. To grow in mind power, watch what you think about.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">Valuable Mental Insight:</P>
<P class="p71 ft5">I must confess; as I look back, deep into my past, I was once a sloppy thinker. I didn't know any better. I just thought and thought and thought. I never thought there was any force involved. I didn't think of my thoughts as good or evil. I thought they were just plain ol' innocent thoughts.</P>
<P class="p50 ft5">Boy was I wrong! Before I knew it, over the years, I had weaved a super steel cable, that would later bind and entrap me. All from being a careless thinker. I didn't know, that if you're not careful, and watch what you think about, you could end up in mental "gridlock".</P>

<P class="p21 ft4">Any other kind of problems?</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">If you do...</P>
<P class="p288 ft4">Here's my simple <NOBR>three-step</NOBR> formula for completely eliminating them from your life:</P>
<P class="p289 ft3">Step #1 - Completely eliminate the word "problem" from your vocabulary.</P>
<P class="p68 ft5">The first step to completely eliminating problems from your life is to completely eliminate the word "problem" from your vocabulary.</P>
<P class="p290 ft4">The "Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary" defines the word problem as:</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">"A thing that is difficult to deal with or to understand."</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Thus...</P>
<P class="p291 ft5">By its very definition, the word problem implies difficulty and, more often than not, is accompanied by all sorts of destructive emotions.</P>

<DIV id="id67_1">
<P class="p0 ft4">Rather than call something a "problem", why not call it what it</P>
<P class="p18 ft4">really is...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">A situation.</P>
<P class="p225 ft4">The "Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary" defines the word situation as:</P>
<P class="p292 ft4">"All the circumstances and things that are happening at a particular time and in a particular place."</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">That's exactly what a problem *really* is, isn't it?</P>
<P class="p293 ft5">A <NOBR>so-called</NOBR> problem is nothing more or less than a given set of circumstances and things that are happening at a particular time and in a particular place.</P>
<P class="p43 ft4">What makes a situation a "problem" is the difficulty *you* assign to it.</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">In other words...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">A problem isn't really a problem...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">It's a situation.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">You make a situation a problem by how you label it!</P>
<P class="p175 ft5">By simply <NOBR>re-labeling</NOBR> a problem as a situation, and *meaning* it, you remove the difficulty and destructive emotions associated with it and put yourself in the necessary state of mind to constructively deal with it.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Once you've reduced a problem to what it really is...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Just another situation in your life...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">You're ready for...</P>

<DIV id="id68_1">
<P class="p0 ft3">Step #2 - Forget it.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Don't talk about the situation...</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">Don't think about the situation...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Forget it!</P>
<P class="p294 ft5">After some eight years of studying the writings of Wallace D. Wattles, best known for his classic masterpiece "The Science of Getting Rich", I'm pretty much convinced "forget it" was Wallace D. Wattles' favorite phrase.</P>
<P class="p231 ft4">Throughout his writings, it's his answer to practically everything that "ails" you.</P>
<P class="p149 ft4">In an article he wrote, titled "Talk That Builds Health", Wallace D. Wattles explains why:</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">"When you forget it, it will be gone."</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">That's exactly what happens too...</P>
<P class="p5 ft4">It's absolutely incredible just how much "stuff" in my life cleaned itself up or disappeared completely simply because I "forgot it".</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">Now...</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">"Forget it" is easier said than done, isn't it?</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Trying to forget something is a bit like trying not to think about</P>
<P class="p37 ft4">pink elephants...</P>
<P class="p22 ft4">The more you try *not* to think about them, the more you think about them, don't you?</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">So...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">How do you forget about pink elephants?</P>

<DIV id="id69_1">
<P class="p0 ft4">Simple...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Think about blue elephants.</P>
<P class="p295 ft5">When you change your focus from pink elephants to blue elephants, the pink elephants disappear all by themselves, don't they?</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">Thus...</P>
<P class="p71 ft3">Step #3 - Focus your attention on the situation you want, not on the one you don't want.</P>
<P class="p24 ft4">There is a Creative Power within you that makes your life into the exact image of that to which you focus your attention.</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">If you focus your attention on the situation you want...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">That's exactly what you'll have...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">The situation you want.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">On the other hand...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">If you focus your attention on the situation you don't want...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">That's exactly what you'll have...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">The situation you *don't* want.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">This is the way the Universe works!</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">So...</P>
<P class="p25 ft5">Rather than focus your attention on an undesirable situation you might find yourself in, focus your attention instead on a desirable situation you'd prefer.</P>

<DIV id="id70_1">
<P class="p0 ft4">For example...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Should you find yourself in an undesirable financial situation,</P>
<P class="p18 ft4">ask yourself what it's opposite would be...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">What a desirable financial situation would be.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Then...</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">Imagine yourself as if you were already there...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">In that desirable financial situation.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">And...</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">Keep your attention focused there...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">On yourself in that desirable financial situation.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">The moment you begin doing this...</P>
<P class="p41 ft4">You'll begin moving toward that desirable financial situation and that desirable financial situation will begin moving toward you.</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">And...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">At the same time...</P>
<P class="p40 ft4">You'll find, as I have, that the undesirable financial situation will begin to clean itself up or disappear all by itself.</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">Well...</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">There you have it...</P>
<P class="p296 ft4">My simple three step formula for completely eliminating problems from your life.</P>
<P class="p4 ft4">Don't let its simplicity deceive you.</P>

<P class="p281 ft4">By Dr. Tim Ong</P>
<P class="p299 ft9">Here’s an article by Dr. Tim Ong, the author of “From Fear to Love”, on one of the most common fear – the fear of failure. There is only one real antidote for this. Read this article to find out.</P>
<P class="p217 ft5">Many people fear failures and therefore they never strive for greater things in life. They accept their present condition, even though they don’t like it, because they dare not leave their comfort zones.</P>
<P class="p50 ft5">Fear of failure is one of the biggest obstacles to your success. If you cannot overcome this fear, you’ll resign yourself to the mediocre things in life, not daring to venture forth for bigger and better things. What is even worse is that it’s going to affect your self esteem negatively.</P>
<P class="p300 ft5">Overcoming the fear of failure takes courage. Be bold! As has been said so many times before, there is nothing to fear but fear</P>

<P class="p21 ft4">Fear is an illusion.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">It is not real.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">It is <NOBR>self-created.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p301 ft5">Each time you envisage a future that is undesirable, you create anxiety. Anxiety is a manifestation of fear. Worry too is a manifestation of fear.</P>
<P class="p302 ft5">If you allow yourself to focus on your anxiety, worry or fear, you’ll never be able to move forward. It’s never a good idea to focus on the negative for you attract exactly what you focus on.</P>
<P class="p303 ft20">Instead, choose to focus on the positive, on the outcome that you want. You’ll see a great difference when you do that. When you envisage a desirable future, it generates hope instead of anxiety.</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">Know that you have a choice which you choose to focus on.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Here’s an important advice to overcome your fear of failure:</P>
<P class="p304 ft11">“Do the things you fear and the death of fear is certain”</P>

<P class="p307 ft3">Why Some Affirmations work and Others don’t</P>
<P class="p281 ft4">By Jeff Staniforth</P>
<P class="p308 ft9">This article differentiates the successful affirmations from the unsuccessful ones. Written by Jeff Staniforth, the creator of the popular desktop subliminal affirmation software, it shows you how to create affirmations that work.</P>
<P class="p309 ft5">By definition, an affirmation is a statement repeated time and again either verbally or mentally <NOBR>--</NOBR> or written down. The words of the affirmation statement - in themselves <NOBR>-when</NOBR> spoken, thought of, or written without a pictorial (visualized) or emotional connection <NOBR>--</NOBR> make a very weak affirmation.</P>
<P class="p277 ft5">Affirmations, when worded correctly <NOBR>--</NOBR> and when emotionally charged - are able to tap into the unlimited creative power of your subconscious mind, and manifest your desires.</P>
<P class="p6 ft5">Affirmations are not all created equal. Some are, of course, better than others. There are power affirmations that have been proven again and again to work - and I'll reveal some of them in a moment.</P>
<P class="p8 ft5">When you examine the structure of these power affirmations, you, too, can learn how to create your own powerful affirmations for your specific purposes.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">Consider the following:</P>
<P class="p20 ft4">"I am what I choose to be."</P>
<P class="p310 ft4">"All my needs are met instantaneously." "I love and accept myself exactly as I am."</P>
<P class="p311 ft4">"_____________ comes to me easily and effortlessly." (Fill in</P>
<P class="p18 ft4">the blank with what you desire.)</P>
<P class="p312 ft5">"I am now perfectly healthy in body, mind and spirit." "I now create my wonderful, ideal life."</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">What do the above power affirmations have in common?</P>

<DIV id="page_74">


<DIV id="id74_1">
<P class="p0 ft3">1) They're stated in the present tense.</P>
<P class="p313 ft5">An affirmation is more effective when stated in the present tense. For example; "I now have a wonderful job." Avoid affirming something in the future tense, e.g. "I am going to have a wonderful job" or the results will always be waiting to happen.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">2) They express a positive statement.</P>
<P class="p314 ft5">Affirmations need to be stated in the most positive terms possible. Avoid negative statements. Affirm what you do want, rather than what you don't want. For example: "I am no longer sick." This is a negative statement. Instead, affirm: "I am now perfectly healthy in body, mind and spirit." This statement is much more powerful as it is positive and reinforces your desired goal and doesn't confuse your subconscious mind with the mention of the undesirable condition.</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">3) They're short and specific.</P>
<P class="p315 ft5">Short affirmations are easy to say, and have a far greater impact at the subconscious level than those which are long and wordy. Keeping them specific and to the point adds power as the idea is uncluttered by extraneous elements.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">The mechanics that make affirmations powerful are:</P>
<P class="p21 ft11">Repetition</P>
<P class="p316 ft4">The importance of repetition cannot be overemphasized. It imprints the affirmation into your subconscious mind.</P>
<P class="p4 ft11">Emotions</P>
<P class="p317 ft5">Get involved, be passionate, and use your emotions. Think carefully about the meaning of the words as you repeat them rather than just writing, typing or saying them.</P>
<P class="p21 ft11">Persistence</P>
<P class="p318 ft5">Practicing affirmations with persistence achieves results much sooner than practicing them periodically. Successive sessions will have a compounding effect.</P>
<P class="p21 ft11">Belief</P>
<P class="p18 ft4">You don't necessarily have to believe your affirmation initially,</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="id74_2">
<P class="p0 ft2">This HTML is created from PDF at <NOBR><A href="https://www.pdfonline.com/convert-pdf-to-html/">https://www.pdfonline.com/convert-pdf-to-html/</A></NOBR></P>
</DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_75">


<DIV id="id75_1">
<P class="p54 ft5">in order for it to work. Belief will grow with your forthcoming successes. What you do need is the ability to feel what it would be like when the desire you're affirming is fulfilled, or your need met. Every time that you have a need <NOBR>--</NOBR> and that need is met <NOBR>--</NOBR> a certain "feeling" is produced in you. You need to evoke that same feeling when you state your affirmation. In other words, you need to feel with every fiber of your being that what you desire has already happened. Without this feeling, your affirmation is powerless.</P>
<P class="p46 ft11">Impress Yourself</P>
<P class="p319 ft5">Personalize your affirmations. They must resonate with you <NOBR>--</NOBR> feel right for you. The stronger your connection with the affirmation, the deeper the impression it makes on your mind, and the sooner you will experience positive results.</P>
<P class="p25 ft5">So there you have it - the simple formula for creating affirmations that work. Based on the above, you can easily create your own affirmations to manifest any desire or need you have in life.</P>
<P class="p320 ft5">TIP: Although the practice of affirmations is easy, some people find it challenging to repeat the affirmations continuously while maintaining the highly charged emotional state necessary in making affirmations work. DID YOU KNOW... that you can use your computer to make the affirmation process effortless - and that you can automate those challenging aspects (such as maintaining highly charged emotions), and thereby, manifest your desires more quickly? Go to affirmware.com.au to find out how.</P>

<P class="p323 ft3">Seek ye First</P>
<P class="p281 ft4">By John Terry</P>
<P class="p324 ft11">In this article, John Terry points out one very important aspect of attracting wealth. If you want to receive, start first by giving.</P>
<P class="p325 ft5">This will probably sound like the most unlikely place to look for wealth, but if you consider the true source of all things, it makes perfect sense.</P>
<P class="p138 ft5">In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught his disciples that, “No man can serve two masters … Ye cannot serve God and mammon,” or the world (Matt 6:24). After suggesting to his disciples that they “take no thought for your life, what ye should eat, or what ye shall drink,” he told them, “seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all things shall be added unto to you” (Matt 6:22). He didn’t say some, or part, or a portion, but “all things.”</P>
<P class="p130 ft5">Just moments earlier, he prefaced these very words by promising that those who would give their alms, offerings to the poor and needy, secretly, that the Father would reward them openly (Matt 6:18). Is there sufficient faith to follow this teaching and live this way today?</P>
<P class="p68 ft5">Here is what I’m <NOBR>suggesting—if</NOBR> you want to acquire wealth, perhaps greater than you can even imagine, then find ways to give it away, anonymously, that will serve God and build up the kingdom of God. It is a sure <NOBR>thing—God’s</NOBR> promise to the faithful.</P>

<P class="p326 ft3">Ten Ways Holographic Creation is more Powerful than Visualization</P>
<P class="p281 ft4">By Christopher Westra</P>
<P class="p327 ft9">Chistopher Westra, the author of “I Create Reality” clarifies in this article the difference between his holographic creation and visualization.</P>
<P class="p328 ft5">“This thing that we call Time is only an illusion. The only moment is now. Waiting is a state of mind. Basically it means that you want the future and don’t want the present. The key is to break the old patterns of present moment denial and present moment resistance.” - Dr. Robert Anthony</P>
<P class="p85 ft5">Creating reality in the moment is Holographic creation. You can also call it manifesting in Holographic time. You create what you want on a spiritual level (quantum level), and then it grows until it becomes crystallized into physical reality. All these ten comparisons between Holographic creation and visualization are based in the fact that there is no such thing as time. As Robert Anthony said in the quote at the start of this chapter, “The only moment is now”.</P>
<P class="p329 ft5">Note – Some people who are skilled at visualization are actually doing Holographic creation without knowing it. Visualization (seeing detailed images) is part of Holographic creation. This chapter fully explains the differences between the two.</P>
<P class="p21 ft4">So when I speak of visualization, I’m talking about the limited</P>

<P class="p168 ft5">version of visualization as traditionally taught. Visualization is very powerful for some people precisely because they understand the deeper laws of Holographic creation! Now you have these keys to manifestation also!</P>
<P class="p20 ft3">1. Present vs. Future</P>
<P class="p330 ft5">Holographic creation is a present activity. You build your creations in the present, not in the future. Your focus is truly in the eternal now. Visualization is <NOBR>future-based.</NOBR> Visualization is focused on a desired future, not on creating something in the present.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">2. Actual creation vs. Pictures</P>
<P class="p285 ft5">Holographic creation is really creating something. Holographic creations are real entities. They are made of matter (just a more refined matter – not visible to us now). Visualization works with pictures. Visualizations are images, and are not usually considered as having a real “existence”.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">3. Permanent vs. Short Lived</P>
<P class="p331 ft5">A properly constructed Holographic creation has the power of permanence. They have continued existence after they are created. They grow independently while you go on to do other things. A visualization is <NOBR>short-lived.</NOBR> If all you are doing is visualizing, your visualizations stop living and existing when you stop visualizing. The picture disappears.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">4. <NOBR>Multi-Dimensional</NOBR> vs. Two Dimensional</P>
<P class="p332 ft5">Holographic creation is at least <NOBR>four-dimensional.</NOBR> It is actually a <NOBR>multi-dimensional</NOBR> process (more than four) but four is about all we can understand while in this current time and space game.</P>
<P class="p248 ft5">Visualizations are <NOBR>two-dimensional.</NOBR> Visual images are merely representations in our mind.</P>
<P class="p20 ft3">5. Inner World vs. Outer World</P>
<P class="p129 ft5">Holographic creation is focused on creation in the inner world of thought, light, energy, and sound. In reality, it’s all energy. Youknow that the outer manifestation of your thought creations are simply a natural result of the inner manifestation.</P>

<DIV id="id79_1">
<P class="p333 ft5">Visualization is focused on outer reality. The focus in visualization is on the physical world, with little or no emphasis on spiritual <NOBR>pre-creation.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p175 ft5"><SPAN class="ft21">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">Emotional Power vs. Detailed Images Only </SPAN>Holographic creation uses emotion. You can only do Holographic creation if you properly use your emotions. You actually feel the emotions you want to feel. The Holographic creation sheet helps because you have to actually write down the name of the emotion. You have to decide what emotion you want to feel – confident, joyful, connected, and energetic, and feel the emotion in the present moment!</P>
<P class="p36 ft5">Visualization doesn’t include emotion. Note - many promoters of visualization have discovered the power of emotions and added this to their visualizing program, which is a great plus. Again – Millions of people have found visualization powerful, and it can be. But millions of others have found no benefit. By itself, visualization doesn’t include all the steps. Some find the keys to effectiveness on their own, and some don’t. Holographic creation contains all the elements, and that’s why it’s so effective at creating what you want in life!</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">7. Gratitude vs. Grasping</P>
<P class="p315 ft5">Holographic creation uses gratitude to align your energies. Proper gratitude is an inherent part of Holographic creation. Gratitude aligns your energies with the inner world and allows you to manifest in an easy manner. When you decide to create something good in your life, you must be grateful for what you already have in that area of your life. Trying to manifest from a state of total dissatisfaction with your life (ingratitude) is not effective. It also doesn’t reflect the reality of the many blessings you do have.</P>
<P class="p334 ft5">In visualization there is no emphasis on gratitude. Most often in visualization there is simply wanting, craving, and grasping with no thankfulness for present blessings. You can find things to be grateful for in any area of your life. The Holographic creation sheet makes you find these areas because you have to write it down!</P>

<P class="p0 ft3">8. Hope vs. Doubt</P>
<P class="p335 ft5">Holographic creation generates amazing hope and confidence. When your energies are aligned, and you absolutely know you are creating in the inner reality, you feel so good! You can feel your creations growing and crystallizing into the “denser” physical reality.</P>
<P class="p9 ft5">Hope is a full expectation of desirable things to come. With Holographic creation, you have this full expectation. Visualization works somewhere between doubt and hope. Most people who practice visualization hardly have that “full expectation” that the things they are visualizing will really become reality.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">9. Welcoming vs. Needing</P>
<P class="p336 ft5">Holographic creation leads to a relaxed welcoming of desires. There is a divine unconcern that is an integral part of manifesting.</P>
<P class="p25 ft5">Holocreation naturally produces this mental state. You have confidence because you know the reality of inner creation. This relaxed state leads to peace, oneness, patience, and effective action.Visualization usually stems from a needing, grasping desire. Because there is no work in inner reality, there is often a fear that what one desires will not come to pass. This fearful needing leads to discontent, impatience, hurry, and frantic action.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">10. Always Works vs. Sometimes Works</P>
<P class="p306 ft5">Holographic creation always works. The laws of manifesting physical creation through prior Holographic (spiritual) creation always work. You just have to learn the laws and practice the methods.</P>
<P class="p217 ft5">Visualization sometimes has great results. When visualization “works”, it’s because the individual is naturally and intuitively including many of the elements of Holographic creation. Their results will improve by understanding the principles in a conscious way.</P>
